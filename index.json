There are many different ways to explore a data set using R. In this example, I just provide some functions that I frequently use for data exploration at work. Also, I assume that you already have some foundational knowledge about R programming. Furthermore, if you have some background in fisheries, this post would make a lot of sense.\r# importing data\rage.at.length \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;age_length_data.csv\u0026quot;)\rcatch.at.length \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;catch_length.csv\u0026quot;)\r# data exploration\rclass(age.at.length)\r## [1] \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\rdim(age.at.length) \r## [1] 65 13\rsapply(age.at.length, class)\r## length age.3 age.4 age.5 age.6 age.7 age.8 age.9\r## \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;\r## age.10 age.11 age.12 age.13 age.14\r## \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;\rSo far, I know that age.at.length contains the information of fish age and length and is a data frame consisting of 65 rows and 14 columns. Furthermore, the function sapply() tells me that all the values are integers.\rclass(catch.at.length)\r## [1] \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;\rdim(catch.at.length) \r## [1] 65 2\rsapply(catch.at.length, class)\r## Length Count\r## \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;\rThe same technique is applied to explore the data of catch.at.length. It is a data frame of two variables: fish length and count (i.e., the number of fish) consisting of 65 records.\r\rVisualization of catch at length\rAt this point, I would be curious to see how many fish are measured at a particular length. For this purpose, a bar plot can be generated using an R-base function. It is noted that ggplot2 or some other packages can do this type of plotting very well, but I would prefer to use simple techniques where possible.\rbarplot(catch.at.length$Count,names=catch.at.length$Length,\rxlab = \u0026quot;Length\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Number of fish\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Catch at length\u0026quot;,\rcol = \u0026quot;lightblue\u0026quot;, border = NA)\r\rFigure 1. Barplot of Catch at length\r\r\rVisualization of catch at age\rAt this stage, measurements of length at age and catch at length are available. I would be curious to see how many fish are caught at particular ages. For this purpose, catch at age data is required. The computation of generating catch at age is presented as follows.\r\r\rCompute the proportion of age at length\r\r\rCatch at age = proportion of age at length * catch at length\r\r\rGenerate a bar plot for the catch at age\r\r\r\rR code for computing catch at age is shown bellow.\rlibrary(dplyr)\rage.at.length \u0026lt;- age.at.length %\u0026gt;% mutate(total=apply(age.at.length[,-1],1,sum)) # create a new column for the total of catch\rage.at.length.in.proportion \u0026lt;- age.at.length[,c(2:14)]/age.at.length$total # compute the proportion of age at length\rcatch.at.age \u0026lt;- age.at.length.in.proportion*catch.at.length$Count # compute catch at age\rcatch.at.age \u0026lt;- apply(catch.at.age[,-13],2,sum, na.rm = T) # compute the total of catch for each age\r# view the catch at age data\rcatch.at.age\r## age.3 age.4 age.5 age.6 age.7 age.8 age.9 age.10 age.11 age.12 age.13\r## 14.000 13.000 18.000 17.000 17.000 12.000 15.000 20.375 20.500 16.125 19.000\r## age.14\r## 18.000\rIt is now simple to generate a bar chart for catch at age using an R-base code.\rbarplot(catch.at.age,names=c(3:14),\rxlab = \u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Number of fish\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Catch at age\u0026quot;,\rcol = \u0026quot;lightblue\u0026quot;, border = NA)\r\rFigure 2. Bar plot of catch at age\r\r\rVisualization of the distribution of age at length\rAt this point, I am aware that there are some fish of the same age, but their lengths are varied; also, some other fish having the same measurement of length, but their ages are different. How would the data be visualized to get a better insight into it? The code is shown below.\rage.at.length.in.proportion.t \u0026lt;- t(age.at.length.in.proportion)\rcolnames(age.at.length.in.proportion.t) \u0026lt;- catch.at.length$Length\rrow.names(age.at.length.in.proportion.t) \u0026lt;- c(3:15)\rlibrary(RColorBrewer)\roptions(warn = -1)\rcol1 \u0026lt;- brewer.pal(nrow(age.at.length.in.proportion.t), \u0026quot;Paired\u0026quot;)\rbarplot(age.at.length.in.proportion.t[-13,], col = col1, xlim = c(0, 88),\rxlab = \u0026quot;Length (unit)\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;The distribution of age at length\u0026quot;, border = NA)\rlegend1 \u0026lt;- legend(\u0026quot;topright\u0026quot;,legend = c(3:14), title = \u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;, fill = col1, box.col = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;)\r\rFigure 3. Bar plot of age at length distribution\r\r\nAs shown in figure 3, it is clear that fish of length \u0026gt; 116 cm is 14 years old. At the ages of 3, 4, and 5, their lengths distribute in three ranges (53-57, 65-69, and 73-79 cm), respectively. In contrast, the other age classes consist of fish with diverse length measurements.\r\rVisualization of the distribution of catch at age over time\rThe example presented in figure 2 is the distribution of catch at age in one year. If the catch at length is recorded for many years by commercial fishers, also length at age is available from some ageing work. It would be interesting to see how the distribution of catch at age changes over time. A new data set called “catch.at.length.ts1.csv” is used for this example.\r# importing the data\rcatch.at.length.ts \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;catch.at.length.ts1.csv\u0026quot;)\rcolnames(catch.at.length.ts) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;length\u0026quot;,array(1959:2016)) # re-name columns\rIn figure 2 example, catch at age was computed for one year only; however, this example contains a series of years from 1959 to 2017. Therefore, the use of a for loop would make the calculation for multiple years efficient. The code is presented below.\rX \u0026lt;- age.at.length.in.proportion[,-13]\rY \u0026lt;- catch.at.length.ts[,-1]\rS1 \u0026lt;- list()\rS2 \u0026lt;- list()\rS3 \u0026lt;- list()\rfor (i in 1:ncol(Y)) {\rS1[i] \u0026lt;- subset(Y, select = c(i))\rS2[[i]] \u0026lt;- X * S1[[i]]\rS3[[i]] \u0026lt;- apply(S2[[i]],2,sum,na.rm=T)\r}\rcatch.at.age.ts \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(do.call(cbind,S3))\rcolnames(catch.at.age.ts) \u0026lt;- c(1959:2016)\rrow.names(catch.at.age.ts) \u0026lt;- c(3:14)\rM \u0026lt;- as.matrix(catch.at.age.ts)\rM \u0026lt;- M%*%diag(1/apply(M,2,sum))\rcolnames(M) \u0026lt;- c(1959:2016)\rOnce the required data is ready, it will be simple to plot a bar chart to examine the distribution of catch at age over multiple years.\r# Proportion at age\rbarplot(M, col = col1, xlim = c(0, 80), main = \u0026quot;Propotion at age\u0026quot;,\rxlab = \u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;, border = NA)\rlegend1 \u0026lt;- legend(\u0026quot;topright\u0026quot;,legend = c(3:14), title = \u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;, fill = col1, box.col = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;)\r\rFigure 4. Bar plot of catch at age over time\r\r\nThis is the end of the first post in fisheries data visualization using R. The code presented here is just one of many ways to do the visualization.

An illustration of  Gambusia holbrooki . Drawing by S. Laurie-Bourque. The introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species are severe issues corresponding with environmental and economic losses, particularly in freshwater habitats. The pest fish,  Gambusia holbrooki , is now a prioritized target of eradication from Tasmania. However, there is a limited quantitative analysis of their population dynamics due to little information on fish ageing. This study centred on the use of otoliths (sagittae and lapilli) to determine daily age for the species. Of 394 fish collected from March to June 2018, 193 (~50%) were successfully aged. Sample preparation was successful for lapilli removed from fish, while preparation of sagittae succeeded for the full range of sampled fish (7mm ≤ TL ≤41 mm). Growth increments appeared as a combination of an opaque and a translucent band in polished otoliths. Ageing reared fish found that increment counts rarely equalled but proportionally correlated to known age. Therefore, estimates of age for wild fish were computed using numbers of increments counted from reading sagittae. Figure 2. Growth increments as observed in a polished sagitta of a wild fish (TL=19 mm, estimated age=38 days post birth). Scale bar = 20 µm. A multi-model approach was applied to describe the growth of  G. holbrooki  versus daily time-series data. Akaike’s information criteria revealed that the power equation outperformed the other candidate models in processing reared fish (Wi = 98% and 59% for females and males respectively) and female wild fish data (Wi = 35%). Von Bertalanffy and logistic equations were best fitted to male fish in the wild (Wi = 27%). Using Pauly's estimator, estimates of the natural mortality rate were 0.035 day-1 and 0.16 day-1 for wild females and males. It was evident that the birth rate was closely correlated with mean temperature changes in Tasmania with peak reproduction in January 2018. Growth rate significantly differed among cohorts birthed at different times. On average, the means of growth rate estimated for the young cohort (0.28 mm/day) was much greater than that of the over−winter cohort (0.12 mm/day). The wild sample ranged from fish of TL=13 mm to 63 mm with the mode of length-frequency from 22−26mm. Mature females dominated the population (2.3 female:1 male) and were typically greater than mature males in total length and total weight. This study, for the first time, provided evidence of using otoliths (sagittae and lapilli) in determining the daily age of  G. holbrooki  with the opportunity of quantitively examining biological characteristics and the dynamics of a population in Tasmania, Australia; which can be used to inform pest control and eradication programs both locally and globally.
